# Ethical Social Engineering – VAPT Awareness Project

##  Project Description
This project demonstrates *Social Engineering attack techniques* from a *defensive and educational perspective*.  
The goal is to *understand how attacks work* so organizations and individuals can *detect and prevent them*.

 This project does NOT promote illegal activity.  
All tools and techniques are used in *controlled lab environments only*.

---

##  Objectives
- Understand social engineering attack vectors
- Learn phishing detection methods
- Perform passive OSINT (legal)
- Improve user awareness & security posture
- Demonstrate ethical use of SEToolkit

##  Social Engineering Attack Types

### 1️ Phishing (Email-Based)
Phishing uses *fraudulent emails* to trick users into:
- Clicking malicious links
- Downloading malware
- Sharing credentials

#### Common Indicators:
- Urgent language
- Suspicious sender
- Fake domains
- Grammar mistakes

---

### 2️ Vishing (Voice-Based – Theory)
Vishing is *voice phishing*, where attackers impersonate:
- Bank officials
- Tech support
- Government employees

 Example:
> "Your account is blocked. Please verify OTP."

 *No real calls are made in this project*

---

### 3️ Smishing (SMS-Based – Theory)
Smishing uses *fake SMS messages* containing:
- Malicious links
- Fake delivery notices
- OTP requests

 Example:
> "Your parcel is delayed. Click here."

##  OSINT (Open Source Intelligence – Passive & Legal)

###  Google Dorking (Defensive Awareness)

Used to understand how *public data exposure* happens.

#### Common Google Dorks:
```bash
site:example.com filetype:pdf
intitle:"index of"
inurl:login
filetype:xls password
